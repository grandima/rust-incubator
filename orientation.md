# Orientation

### Perspective

You decided to take part in boot camp. Bootcamp is an intensive, fast-paced learning program that focuses on training individuals in areas of information technology. The fast pace is the most efficient way to build up new skills. If your goal is to get practical skills, then boot camp is much more efficient than university, pet projects, and even a job unless you already have all critical skills.

Also, Rust is not the worst choice nowadays:

- [A large and friendly community](https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/growing-the-rust-community-6b6d23725085)
- [Trending language: 7 years in a row as a favorite programming language ](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)
- [Fast](–®–≤–∏–¥–∫–∏–π) and [secure](https://vegibit.com/is-rust-the-future-of-systems-programming/)
- [Recognition by world leaders: Mozilla, Dropbox, Cloudflare, Discord, AWS](https://www.rust-lang.org/production/users)
- [Rich ecosystem: cargo out of the box](https://lib.rs/stats)
- Rust in the cores of [Linux](https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/12/linux-6-1-rust/) and [Windows](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/microsoft_windows_rust/) : the language will not disappear and will continue to evolve

### Your group

Everyone was enrolled in one of the groups. Every group has 2 mentors. If you are in the morning, the group time of meetings is most probably at 10:00. If you are in the evening, the group time of meetings is most probably at 18:30.

### Routines

You will engage in calls with your peers and mentors four days a week. During these group calls, you are encouraged to ask questions, and you should expect to answer questions from your mentor as well.

### Topology of curriculum

`Section` and `step` are synonyms in most contexts.

Bootcamp consists of 4 parts:

- General part: sections 0, 1, 2, 3
- Specialization part: sections 4, 5
- Capstone project: 6
- Certification test

Currently, we offer only one specialization: "web back-end." The second and third parts can be performed in parallel with the first. You have to work on the third part parallel to the second; otherwise, you can fail to meet the deadline.

### Capstone project

You will create a portfolio project using Rust within a one-week timeframe. The project should showcase your proficiency in Rust, demonstrate your coding style, and highlight your problem-solving skills. The goal is to create a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared with the programming community.

Choose a project idea that is suitable for implementation within a **one-week timeframe**. Consider the complexity and feasibility of the project. You are expected to present your project to your peers and mentors. This will allow you to receive more feedback, further facilitating your growth and learning.

### Certificate

If you complete all tasks on time, successfully present your capstone project, and achieve a high score on the certification test, you will earn a **professional certificate**. We're dedicated to ensuring our certificate is recognized both in Ukraine and internationally.

### Certification Test

Our certification process is designed to uphold the utmost integrity and trustworthiness. We employ stringent measures to prevent cheating and ensure a fair testing environment for all participants.

During the certification test, participants will be [supervised by a proctor][certification test]. We require participants to use two cameras and share their desktop throughout the test, to prevent unauthorized communication. Additionally, we will monitor all active processes on the participant's computer at the beginning and throughout the test to further prevent any fraudulent activities.

It's worth mentioning that passing the certification test is a challenge due to its complex and tricky questions. Each participant is allowed **only one attempt** to pass the test. However, a shortened version of the test will be publicly available for practice. Participants who finish the first or second part of the program ahead of others, or those whose capstone project receives the most likes from mentors during presentation, will be awarded an extra attempt.

Any attempt to cheat during the certification test will result in immediate exclusion from the boot camp.

> üí° Advice: It is worth going through as many quizzes as you can find online before taking the certification test. You should master rustlings and exorcism drills and review as much code of others as you can because certification tests evaluate not only your understanding of concepts but also your ability to read code quickly.

### Soft and Hard Deadlines

In this bootcamp, we implement two types of deadlines: soft deadlines and hard deadlines.

1. **Soft Deadlines**: These are flexible deadlines designed to help keep you on track. Every soft deadline is set for **Thursday** at midnight. We tolerate up to two instances of not meeting a soft deadline. However, if you fail to meet a soft deadline for a third time, this will lead to exclusion.
2. **Hard Deadlines**: These are strict deadlines that must be adhered to. Each hard deadline is set for **Sunday** at midnight. Failing to meet a hard deadline will result in immediate exclusion.

Each section of our program has its own deadline. Please note that some sections may take more than one week to complete. We use a week as our standard unit of measurement.

We encourage you to meet all deadlines to maximize your learning experience and successfully complete the bootcamp.

> üí° Advice: Tasks 4.4 and 6 are non-trivial and will easily take a week of work. Make sure you reserve more than a few days for these tasks.

### Honor code

We ask you to complete the assignments independently and not to share your own work. Since you will receive certificates at the end of the course, we will carefully check your work for Plagiarism. A person who uses the work of another person and another person **both will be excluded** if such an incident occurs.

### Get help from mentors and peers

You are welcome to **ask questions** in our chat without asking to share a solution.

Please be **respectful and polite** to peers and mentors.

> üí° Advice: mutual support is our value. Don't underestimate the importance of soft skills.

### Exclusion

The list of reasons for being excluded from the group includes but is not limited to

- [Plagiarism]
- Failure to meet more than 2 [soft deadlines]
- Failure to meet any of [hard deadlines]
- Systematic violation of the rules
- On your own request

> üí° Advice: If you must leave the group prematurely, please do so respectfully. We encourage you to provide publicly a brief explanation or acknowledgment before departing. Remember, we are all human and understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, so there will be no hard feelings if you must leave the bootcamp early.
