# Orientation

### Perspective

You decided to take part in boot camp. Bootcamp is an intensive, fast-paced learning program that focuses on training individuals in areas of information technology. The fast pace is the most efficient way to build up new skills. If your goal is to get practical skills, then boot camp is much more efficient than university, pet projects, and even a job unless you already have all critical skills.

Also, Rust is not the worst choice nowadays.

### Your group

Everyone was enrolled in one of the groups. Every group has 2 mentors. If you are in the morning, the group time of meetings is most probably at 10:00. If you are in the evening, the group time of meetings is most probably at 18:30.

### Routines

You are going to have calls with your peers and mentor(s) 4 days a week you will have a call with your group and mentor(s). During a call, you are encouraged to ask questions. A mentor is going to ask you questions as well.

### Topology of curriculum

`Section` and `step` are synonyms in most contexts.

Bootcamp consists of 4 parts:

- General part: sections 0, 1, 2, 3
- Specialization part: sections 4, 5
- Capstone project: 6
- Certification test

Currently, we offer only one specialization: "web back-end." The second and third parts can be performed in parallel with the first. You have to work on the third part parallel to the second; otherwise, you can fail to meet the deadline.

### Certification Test

Certification is done [in a way which][certification test] makes it nearly impossible to cheat. We go to extreme lengths to make certificates trustworthy. During the test, a participant is watched by a proctor. We ask a participant to use two cameras and share a desktop to exclude chatting. Also, we check running processes at the beginning and during testing. Attempt to cheat during certification test cause exclusion from the boot camp.

> üí° Advice: It is worth going through as many quizzes as you can find online before taking the certification test. You should master rustlings and exorcism drills and review as much code of others as you can because certification tests evaluate not only your understanding of concepts but also your ability to read code quickly.

### Certificate

If you'll do all tasks on time, present the capstone project and earn a high enough score on the certification test -- you will **get a professional certificate**. We work hard to make it recognizable in Ukraine and abroad.

### Deadlines

There are 2 kinds of deadlines: soft and hard. Failure to meet hard deadline cause exclusion. We tolerate up to 2 failures to meet soft deadlines.

Each section has a deadline. Every soft deadline is on Thursday at midnight. Every hard deadline is on Sunday at midnight.

> üí° Advice: Tasks 4.4 and 6 are non-trivial and will easily take a week of work. Make sure you reserve more than a few days for these tasks.

### Getting started

To get started, please [follow the instruction][Get Started].

### Honor code

We ask you to complete the assignments independently and not to share your own work. Since you will receive certificates at the end of the course, we will carefully check your work for Plagiarism. A person who uses the work of another person and another person **both will be excluded** if such an incident occurs.

### Get help from mentors and peers

You are welcome to **ask questions** in our chat without asking to share a solution.

Please be **respectful and polite** to peers and mentors.

> üí° Advice: mutual support is our value. Don't underestimate the importance of soft skills.

### Exclusion

The list of reasons for being excluded from the group includes but is not limited to

- [Plagiarism]
- Failure to meet [deadlines]
- Systematic violation of the rules
- On your own request

> üí° Advice: Please don't leave your group silently or with a loud slam of the door. Be accountable and **give a few words of acknowledgments** leaving the group ahead of time. We all are human, so we understand and don't blame you for leaving boot camp, whatever circumstances you have.
