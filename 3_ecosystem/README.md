Step 3: Ecosystem
=================

__Estimated time__: <!-- TODO --> days

These steps describe common crates and tools in [Rust] ecosystem required for web backend development.

Before completing this step you should complete all its sub-steps. After doing them you should be able to answer the following questions:
- What testing capabilities does [Rust] offer and when should I use them? Why should I follow [BDD] style?
- What are macros? How do they differ? What benefits does their usage give? When should I write one?
- How to work with date and time in [Rust]? How should I store time? How should I return it to other applications?
- How are regular expressions used in [Rust]? When are they not enough? How can I write a custom parser in [Rust]?
- How do iterator and collection compare and differ in [Rust]? What is the purpose of immutable collections? Why should I care about using concurrent collections?
- What should I use for serialization in [Rust]? Why this is good or bad?
- How can I generate randomness in [Rust]? Which guarantees of random generator should I choose and when?
- What should I use for password hashing in [Rust]? How can I encrypt a message with [Rust]? How should I compare secret values and why?
- How logging is organized in [Rust] ecosystem? Why should I care about structured logging?
- What should I use for building CLI interface in [Rust]? How can I organize a configuration for my application and why?
- Why multithreading is required for [Rust] programs and what problems does it solve? How threads concurrency differs with parallelism? How can I parallelize code in [Rust]?
- What is asynchronicity and what problems does it solve? How is it compared to threads concurrency? What is [Rust] solution for asynchronicity and why it has such design?
- What are actors? When are they useful?




## Task

<!-- TODO -->

If you have enough time after implementing base requirements, consider to do the following for your solution:
- Add comprehensive documentation to your code;
- Cover your implementation with unit and E2E tests.
