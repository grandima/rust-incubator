Step 5: Choose your capstone project
=========================

__Estimated time__: 1 day

Choose your capstone project. The project should showcase your proficiency in Rust, demonstrate your coding style, and highlight your problem-solving skills. The goal is to create a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared with the programming community.

Choose a project idea that is suitable for implementation within a one-week timeframe. Consider the complexity and feasibility of the project.

Consider this project as an opportunity to learn and grow your skills in Rust. Challenge yourself by exploring new Rust features, libraries, or patterns, and incorporate them into your project where appropriate.

If you're having trouble finding a suitable subject for your project, don't hesitate to ask your mentors for suggestions.
