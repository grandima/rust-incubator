Step 6: Capstone project
=========================

Congratulation! You've almost done it!

Create a portfolio project using Rust within a one-week timeframe. The project should showcase your proficiency in Rust, demonstrate your coding style, and highlight your problem-solving skills. The goal is to create a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared with the programming community.

## Step 6.1: Agree on your capstone project

Choose a project idea that is suitable for implementation within a one-week timeframe. Consider the complexity and feasibility of the project.

Consider this project as an opportunity to learn and grow your skills in Rust. Challenge yourself by exploring new Rust features, libraries, or patterns, and incorporate them into your project where appropriate.

If you're having trouble finding a suitable subject for your project, don't hesitate to ask your mentors for suggestions.

> ❗️ You have to approve the subject of the project with your mentor.

## Step 6.2: Get approvement of basic implementation from the first mentor

Design and develop your project. Don't aim to get the product ready. You have just a few days on this. Make sure you are implementing a minimal version of your project, don't bother to write a perfect implementation. Get the approval of your mentor.

## Step 6.3: Get 4 reviews from peers and mentors

It's important to be able to work in a team and respect senior members of your team as well as value the strengths of your peers. Get 4 reviews from peers and mentors, and follow most of the pieces of advice you will get. Among 4 reviews should be at least one peer and at least one mentor from another group.

## Step 6.4: Present your project

In an efficient team, teammates are not afraid to be vulnerable. Present your project to peers and mentors. Receive more feedback.

Congrats! At this stage, you already have a minimum portfolio.
